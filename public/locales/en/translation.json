      "comment": "Burger Heaven is my favorite spot for a burger night! I especially recommend their **BBQ Burger** – juicy meat, delicious BBQ sauce, and crispy onion rings. This combination is addictive! The restaurant atmosphere is pleasant, and the staff is very friendly. I’ll definitely be back!"

      "comment": "The cheeseburger from Burger Heaven is a classic at its best. Perfectly melted cheese, fresh bun, and well-seasoned meat. The only thing I’d change is adding a bit more veggies inside. Other than that, the place is clean, and the service is fast. Worth a visit!"

      "comment": "Today I had the chance to try the **Classic Burger**, and I must say, it’s one of the best classics I’ve had. Simple, yet perfectly balanced composition of ingredients. The bun was fresh, the meat well-cooked, and the sauces blended well with the rest. The perfect place for a quick lunch!"

      "comment": "I ordered the **Cheeseburger** and **BBQ Burger** to go. Both were very tasty, but **BBQ Burger** was my absolute favorite. Great flavor combination and perfect for those who like sweet and spicy at the same time. The only downside was the longer waiting time, but it was worth it!"
